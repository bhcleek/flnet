Flnet provides the Amateur Radio Net Control Station operator with a real
time tool to assist him or her in managing the net activities.  A single
dialog with multiple panels is used to allow rapid entry, search, pick
and display of all stations calling in to the net.  All operations on
the main dialog are accomplished with keyboard entries only.  No mouse
action is required to perform the net control functions.  Experience
has shown that most net control operators prefer this method of operation
to improve the speed of entry and selection

\section mainControlDialog Main Dialog

Invoke flnet by clicking on the desktop program icon.  The main dialog will
open.  If this is not the first execution, the program will load the last 
used database file.  Use the <i>Files</i> menu to either start a new or open
an existing database file.

<center>
\image latex Select_csvfile.png "" width=4.9in

</center>

Either select an existing file or enter a new filename with the csv
extension.  All database files have the extension "csv" which may
optionally be added to the filename.
<br>

\subsubsection ssMainWindowLayout Main Window Layout

The main window is divided into three sections.  The Call In List to the
left contains all of the net members callsigns, nicknames and time of
login, who have been entered for this session.  The data in this window
can be scrolled using the UP and DWN arrow keys.  The callsign contained
within the confines of the two dark arrows is the active
call.  That will be the person who is presently acknowledged by the
control operator.  It is significant for another reason.  The function
keys F1, F2, F3 and F4 when pressed will change the color of that
entry to BLACK, BLUE, GREEN or RED respectively.  The color coding
can be used by the net control operator in any way that he or she
chooses.  One use might choose to designate.

<center>
| Action                | Key       | Color     |
| :-------------------  | :-------: | :-------  |
| Logged in to the net  |    F1     | BLACK     |
| Acknowledged #1       |    F2     | BLUE      |
| Acknowledged #2       |    F3     | GREEN     |
| Logged out            |    F4     | RED       |
</center>

The Function keys and colors are assigned in the configuration dialog.

The right most column is a FLAG that specifies some special characteristic
about that callsign.  For example: this call might be from a mobile
operator, or from a QRP station, or a DX station that requires special
or early recognition by the net operator.  Up to three special flags
may be assigned (\ref sConfigure "see configuration information").

Entering a callsign into the "Call In List" is quite simple.  Key in
the letters associated with the suffix of the call being entered.  As each
letter in entered the calls which match that sequence will be shown in
the pick list just below the Suffix box.

While the various display elements may look like entry fields, scrolling
browsers, etc. THEY ARE NOT!  All of the things shown on the screen are
simple labels that are being manipulated from the keyboard and under program
control.  Standard GUI controls would have the habit of wanting to control
what happens when given keyboard or mouse focus.  That would destroy the
quick response mechanism associated with the net functionality.  You can
click your mouse on these controls all day long and nothing will happen.
You do not use the mouse for the net control function.

<center>
\image latex SelectCall.png "Select Call" width=3.9in
\image html  SelectCall.png "Select Call"
</center>

If the desired call is singular in the list or at the top of the list
you can select it by pressing the ENTER
key.  The call will be transfered to the end of the Call In List along
with the nick name of that member and the time of logging.  If the call
is in the list but not at the top, then press the DOWN (or UP) arrow
key.  Control now passes to the pick list below the Suffix box and the
2nd call in the list will be highlighted RED.  You can move between
entries using the UP and DOWN arrow keys until the desired call is
highlighted.  The list wraps from last to first and first to last.  
Press ENTER to select the highlighted call.

<center>
\image latex CallSelected.png "After selection" width=3.9in
\image html  CallSelected.png "After Selection"
</center>

The newly transfered call may or may not be immediately shown in the Call
In List box depending on whether the box is presently filled with calls.  Do
not be concerned.  It is at the end of the list.  To convince yourself of
this, press the END key after making the selection.  The last call entered
in the Call In List will be moved to the current call position.  Pressing
HOME will put the first call entered in the current call position.

The <i>After Selection</i> image shows the callin list in time order, earliest
to last.  Note the A, B, C flags indicating a priority ordering.  The list
can be reordered by priority, and new entries added by priority.  Setting the Priority
configuration panel item <i>Auto By Priority</i>
<center>
\image latex ConfigPriority.png "" width=3.0in
\image html  ConfigPriority.png ""
</center>
changes the callin list to
<center>
\image latex flnet-callin-by-priority.png "" width=3.9in
\image html  flnet-callin-by-priority.png ""
</center>
The position of the callin list will change to insure that the current call is
at the "up" position as the priority control is toggled.  The callin list ordering
can be toggled between time and priority order using the combination of alt and P keys.

<h3>Transferring Flnet CALL to Fldigi</h3>

To assist the NET control operator the call sign and nickname can be
transfered to FLDIGI.  Select the callsign of the next up net member
(between the arrow indicators).  Then press the ENTER/RETURN key. The call sign 
and the nickname will be transfered to fldigi's logging controls.  It will
be immediately available for use in fldigi's macros.

\subsubsection abortingSelection Aborting the selection process

The operator can abort the selection process at any time by simply
pressing the ESC key.

\subsubsection ssNoCall No calls appear in the pick list

This is because no callsign with that suffix is contained in the
database.  You may have a new log-in to your net.  Press the TAB key to
move to the Prefix box.  Enter the prefix and then TAB again to move to
the Area box.  Enter the number for the area and then press ENTER to
transfer that new call to the Call In List.  You can abort this operation
at any time by pressing the ESC key.

The fields displayed in the lower part of the window are the values
associated with the Call In List current value.  These will change as
you move between log-in entries.

\subsection ssClosingProgram Closing down the program

You close the program by selecting the menu <b>File / Exit</b>, using the
alt-F4 key combination, or the cmd-Q key combination on a Mac.  You will
be prompted to confirm the program shutdown.
<center>
\image latex ConfirmQuit.png "" width=3.0in
\image html  ConfirmQuit.png ""
</center>

The program will update the database if appropriate and create a daily log 
if the Call In List contains values.  The log is an appended file for each 
day of operation.  The name of the log file is 
<ul>
<li><b>databasename</b>YYYY.MM.DD.hhmm.log.</li>
</ul>
Where the YYYY.MM.DD.hhmm is the current date/time value.  If you open the net
multiple times during the day, the data for each session is recorded in a 
separate file.  The data in this file is identical to the Call In List values.
<center>
\image latex LogFileContents.png "" width=3.0in
\image html  LogFileContents.png ""
</center>

\subsection ssOpenNewDB Opening a new or existing database

You may close the current database and open a different one by selecting
the menu button <i>Files / Open</i>.

You may close the current database and create a new one by selecting the
menu butten <i>Files / New</i>.

All of the current information will be saved as when the current data base
is closed.


\subsection ssFileLocations Files / Locations


After running flnet for the first time the program will always open the
last used database.  The name and location of the last used database is
stored in the file

$HOME/flnet.files/flnet.cfg

where $HOME is

<ul>
   <li> on XP : C:\\Documents and Settings\\<username>\\</li>
   <li> on Vista, Win7, Win8 : C:\\Users\\<username>\\</li>
   <li> on Unix, Linux : /home/<username>/</li>
   <li> on OS X : /Users/<username></li>
</ul>

<center>
\image latex files.png "flnet files" width=5.0in
\image html  files.png "flnet files"
</center>

The database files for flnet are simple comma separated value that can
also be opened using a spreadsheet.  You should avoid modifying the contents
of the file using a spreadsheet program.  These files may be stored
anywhere on your computer system.

Each time it starts or opens a new database, flnet will create 2 aged backup 
files of the active database file.

Typical file contents:
<ul>
<li>\ref flnet_csv</li>
<li>\ref flnet_debug_log</li>
<li>\ref flnet_log</li>
<li>\ref flnet_prefs</li>
</ul>

\subsection ssXmlRpcLink Add call-ins using FLNET/FLDIGI XMLRPC's data link.

While running digital nets using FLDIGI, transfering callsign information
from FLDIGI to FLNET is possible.  From FLDIGI's receive window double click or
right click on the callsign and select the 'call' menu item. This action
fills the callsign field.  If you have the call lookp feature set up, press
the QRZ button to fill in the remaining information fields.  Otherwise
use the right click menu items to fill in the relavent data.

Return to FLNET's main window (editor window must be closed). Pressing
Fll or Shift-F12 transfers the data from FLDIGI to FLNET.  If the callsign is not
present in the database it will be created and the following data will be
assigned; callsign, name, nickname, qth, state, logged date, and join date.
The logged in and join dates are set to the local time zone. The transfered
callsign will be added to the call-in list.

If additional information needs to be added or updated. Press the up/down
key to place the newly entered callsign between the two arrows in the call-in
list.  Pressing F12 opens the editor window to the selected callsign.  The
nickname is initially set the the proper first name when the database entry
is created. Modify as needed, the nickname is the information passed back to
FLDIGI's name field. Add/Modify the other fields as required. Press the update
button to save the changes.

\section sEditorDialog Editor Dialog

Net has a built-in editor for maintaining the its database.  You open the
editor by clicking on the menu button "Editor" or by pressing the function
key F12 to edit the current active call in the call-in list.  Of course
this is one of those times that you may use the mouse.  If you are
starting a completely new net database, this is where to start.  You
probably already have most of the information that will be entered into
the database.  Once the net membership has been entered into the database
the operation as net control operator will be very simple and quick.

<center>
\image latex Editor.png "" width=5.0in
\image html Editor.png ""
</center>

These are normal data entry fields.  You move between them using the
mouse, tabs, backspace, arrow keys etc.  The buttons at the bottom of the
window are primarily for moving between or acting upon an entry in the
database.  The arrow keys from left to right allow you to move to the
FIRST, PREVIOUS, NEXT or LAST entry in the database.  The ordering of the
database is controlled by the sort selection of CALLSIGN sort or NET NBR
sort.  You may also go to a specific data entry using a browse window.  The
browse window will either be by callsign or by net nbr.

\subsection ssTransferF2F Transferring Data from FLDIGI to FLNET

Selecting "Fldigi" menu item will transfer Call Sign, Name, QTH, and State
information from the FLDIGI logbook to FLNET. Use of the CALLBOOK feature of
FLDIGI is recommended prior to the transfer.

\subsection ssQueTranfer Transfer selected DB entry to Call-in List

The currently selected database entry can be transfer to the Call-in list
by selecting the "Queue" button located at the bottom of the Editor Window.

\subsection ssFindCall Searching for Callsign / Net number

Searches for existing records can be made by either call or net number.  A
browser selector and search dialog is available for both:

<center>
<table>
<tr>
<td>\image latex BrowseCallsign.png "" width=3.0in
\image html  BrowseCallsign.png ""
</td>
<td>\image latex BrowseNetnbr.png "" width=3.0in
\image html  BrowseNetnbr.png ""
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

Move through either list using the up/down keyboard arrow keys.  Home moves to
first item.  End moves to last item.  Select highlighted item using the Enter key
or with the OK button.  Close the browse dialog using either the close button or with the Escape key.

<center>
<table>
<tr>
<td>\image latex SearchCallsign.png "" width=2.0in
\image html  SearchCallsign.png ""
</td>
<td>\image latex SearchNetnbr.png "" width=2.0in
\image html  SearchNetnbr.png ""
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

Enter the desired call / net number.  You do not need to be concerned about upper/lower case letters.
Execute the search by either pressing the Search button or with the Enter key.

\subsection ssImportQRZ Importing data from External / Online database

flnet can search a variety of external database sources to assist filling in
the various database record elements:
<ul>
<li>callook.info online</li>
<li>hamqth.com online</li>
<li>hamcall.net on line</li>
<li>qrz.com on line</li>
</ul>

\subsection ssEditorSortOrder Editor Sort Order

Change the sort order of the working database:
<ul>
<li>Prefix / Area / Suffix</li>
<li>Area / Prefix / Suffix</li>
<li>Suffix / Area / Prefix</li>
<li>Net number</li>
</ul>
Each change to sort order is indicated in the upper right corner label control.
Changing sort order does not change the current record.

\section sDataFormat Data File Format

flnet 7 data files are ASCII text files.  The file format is comma separated
value (csv) which is the text file format used by most modern spread
sheet programs.

The first line in the file is a header line consisting of the following
comma separated strings:

<ul>
<li>PREFIX</li>
<li>AREA</li>
<li>SUFFIX</li>
<li>CALLSIGN</li>
<li>NAME</li>
<li>NETNBR</li>
<li>LOGDATE</li>
<li>NBRLOGINS</li>
<li>STATUS</li>
<li>JOINED</li>
<li>FNAME</li>
<li>LNAME</li>
<li>ADDR</li>
<li>CITY</li>
<li>STATE</li>
<li>ZIP</li>
<li>PHONE</li>
<li>BIRTHDATE</li>
<li>SPOUSE</li>
<li>SP_BIRTH</li>
<li>COMMENT1</li>
<li>COMMENT2</li>
<li>EMAIL</li>
<li>PREVDATE</li>
<li>LOCATOR</li>
<li>COUNTRY</li>
</ul>

Three fields must be present for flnet to consider the file to contain
valid data: PREFIX, AREA and SUFFIX.

The fields can be in any order and flnet will correctly parse the data.
Record fields must of course be aligned with the respective header name.
For example a file containing records consisting of

ZIP, NAME, SUFFIX, PREFIX, AREA

will be properly parsed.  When the data is saved by flnet the missing fields
will be added (empty if not edited by the user), and the fields realigned
in the default order.

You can open an flnet csv file using Excel, Open Office, Gnumeric, etc.  If
you modify the file just be sure to save it again in the csv format.

<center>
\image latex gnumeric-net.png "" width=7.0in
\image html  gnumeric-net.png ""
</center>

\section sImportPre Importing data from pre flnet 7.x

The database file format used in earlier versions of flnet were based on
Xbase, which is similar to dbase.  These files must be converted to the
csv flat file format before using the exported file in flnet 7.x.

Execute the earlier version of flnet.  Open the desired dbf file and then
open the Editor dialog and press the "Export" menu button:

<center>
\image latex export.png "" width=4.5in
\image html export.png ""
</center>

The file will be saved in the same location as the original dbf file,
using the same filename but with the extension csv.  flnet 7.x will be
able to open and use this file.

\section sConfigure Configuring flnet
\subsection ssUserInterface User interface
<center>
\image latex ConfigUI.png "" width=4.0in
\image html ConfigUI.png ""
</center>

The behavior when logging a new call-in to the net can be changed to suit
the way that your net control operates.

New login is up - Every logged in call sign that is not in the database will
become the "up" position in the Call In List

Open editor for new login - "New login is up" must also be checked.  If both
are checked then in addition to being placed in the up position, the editor
will open so that details can immediately be added to the database.

Current call in is up - Every new log in will move that entry to the "up"
position in the Call In List.
\subsection ssColors Colors
<center>
\image latex ConfigColors.png "" width=4.0in
\image html ConfigColors.png ""
</center>

The function keys F1, F2, F3 and F4 when pressed will change the forground and background colors
of the current callsign (between the arrows in the Check-ins list). The
color coding can be used by the net control operator in any way that he or
she chooses. One use might choose to designate

<center>

| Action                | Color     |
| :-------------------  | :-------  |
| Logged in to the net  | BLACK     |
| Acknowledged #1       | BLUE      |
| Acknowledged #2       | GREEN     |
| Logged out            | RED       |

</center>

These are the default colors. You can modify them to suit your operation.

\subsection ssConfigPriority Priority
<center>
\image latex ConfigPriority.png "" width=4.0in
\image html ConfigPriority.png ""
</center>

The priority characters can be changed to suit the way that your net
operates.  You can also specify certain states to have priority during the
callin process.  This is quite useful for a net with members over a wide
geographic region.  It might be better to allow certain states / regions
early responses to a check in process to accommodate band conditions.

You can check the Auto By Priority box if you want prioritization to be
automatic.
