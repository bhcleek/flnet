<h3>Program Execution</h3>

<h4>Windows:</h4>

<p style="margin-left: 0.42in; margin-bottom: 0in;" align="justify">Invoke
flnet by clicking on the desktop program icon.&nbsp; The main dialog and a file selection dialog will open:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.42in; margin-bottom: 0in;" align="justify"><br>
</p>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100px;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><img style="width: 396px; height: 481px;" alt="" src="flnet.png"></td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><img style="width: 496px; height: 406px;" alt="" src="Select_csvfile.png"><br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p>Either select an existing file or enter a new filename with the csv extension.&nbsp; All
database files have the extension "csv" which may
optionally be added to the filename.<br>
<br>
</p>

<h4>Main Window Layout:</h4>The main window is divided into three sections.
&nbsp;The Call In List to the left contains all of the net members
callsigns, nicknames and time of login, who have been entered for
this session. &nbsp;The data in this window can be scrolled using the
UP and DWN arrow keys. &nbsp;The callsign contained within the
confines of the two dark arrows (WB1HKJ above) is the active call.
&nbsp;That will be the person who is presently acknowledged by the
control operator. &nbsp;It is significant for another reason. &nbsp;The
function keys F1, F2, F3 and F4 when pressed with change the color of
that entry to BLACK, BLUE, GREEN or RED respectively. &nbsp;The color
coding can be used by the net control operator in any way that he or
she chooses. &nbsp;One use might choose to designate

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Logged in to the net&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BLACK</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Acknowledged #1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BLUE</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Acknowledged #2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GREEN</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Logged
out&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
RED</p>

<p align="justify">The colors are selected from the configuration
dialog.<br>
<br>
The right most column is a FLAG that specifies some
special characteristic about that callsign.&nbsp; For example: this
call might be from a mobile operator, or from a QRP station, or a DX
station that requires special or early recognition by the net
operator.&nbsp; Up to three special flags may be assigned (see the
configuration infomation).</p>

<p align="justify">Entering a callsign into the "Call In List"
is quite simple. &nbsp;Key in the letters associated with the suffix
of the call being entered. &nbsp;In the screen above the S has been
entered (case independent). &nbsp;As each letter in entered the calls
which match that sequence will be shown in the pick list just below
the Suffix box.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.83in;" align="justify">While the various
display elements may look like entry fields, scrolling browsers, etc.
THEY ARE NOT! &nbsp;All of the things shown on the screen are simple
labels that are being manipulated from the keyboard and under program
control. &nbsp;Standard GUI controls would have the habit of wanting
to control what happens when given keyboard or mouse focus. &nbsp;That
would destroy the quick response mechanism associated with the net
functionality. &nbsp;You can click your mouse on these controls all
day long and nothing will happen. &nbsp;You don't need the mouse for
the net control function.</p>

<p align="justify">If the desired call is singular in the list or at
the top of the list as is NK2G in the example screen you can select
it by pressing the ENTER key. &nbsp;The call will be transfered to
the end of the Call In List along with the nick name of that member
and the time of logging. &nbsp;If the call is in the list but not at
the top, then press the DOWN (or UP) arrow key. &nbsp;Control now
passes to the pick list below the Suffix box and the 2nd call in the
list will be highlighted RED. &nbsp;You can move between entried
using the UP and DOWN arrow keys until the desired call is
highlighted. &nbsp;Press ENTER to select the highlighted call.</p>

<p align="justify">The newly transfered call may or may not be
immediately shown in the Call In List box depending on whether the
box is presently filled with calls. &nbsp;Do not be concered. &nbsp;It
is at the end of the list. &nbsp;To convince yourself of this, press
the END key after making the selection. &nbsp;The last call entered
in the Call In List will be moved to the current call position.
&nbsp;Pressing HOME will put the first call entered in the current
call position. (see <a href="Function_Keys.html">Function Key</a>
definitions).</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Aborting the selection process:</b> The operator
can abort the selection process at any time by simply pressing the
ESC key.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>No calls appear in the pick list:</b> This is
because no callsign with that suffix is contained in the database.
&nbsp;You may have a new log-in to your net. &nbsp;Press the TAB key
to move to the Prefix box. &nbsp;Enter the prefix and then TAB again
to move to the Area box. &nbsp;Enter the number for the area and then
press ENTER to transfer that new call to the Call In List. &nbsp;You
can abort this operation at any time by pressing the ESC key.<br>
<br>
The
fields displayed in the lower part of the window are the values
associated with the Call In List current value. &nbsp;These will
change as you move between log-in entries.</p>

<h3 align="justify">Closing down the program:</h3>

<p align="justify">You close the program by selecting the menu <b>File
/ Exit.</b> &nbsp;The program will update the database if appropriate
and create a daily log if the Call In List contains values. &nbsp;The
log is an appended file for each day of operation. &nbsp;The name of
the log file is <b>databasename</b>YYYYMMDD.log. &nbsp;Where the
YYYYMMDD is the current days value. &nbsp;If you open the net
multiple times during the day, the data for each session is appended
to the previous for the day. &nbsp;A blank line will appear between
each session. &nbsp;The data in this file is identical to the Call In
List values.</p>

<h3 align="justify">Opening a new database:</h3>

<p align="justify">You may close the current database and open a
different (or create a new one) by selecting the menu button <b>Files
/ Open</b>. &nbsp;All of the current information will be saved as
when the program is closed down above.</p>
