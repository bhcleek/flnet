<h1 align="center">Editor Dialog</h1>
<p align="justify">Net has a built-in editor for maintaining the its
database. &nbsp;You open the editor by clicking on the menu button
"Editor" or by pressing the function key F12 to edit the
current active call in the call-in list.&nbsp; Of course this is one
of those times that you may use the mouse. &nbsp;If you are starting
a completly new net database, this is where to start. &nbsp;You
probably already have most of the information that will be entered
into the database. &nbsp;Once the net membership has been entered
into the database the operation as net control operator will be very
simple and quick.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" align="center"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 543px; height: 488px;" alt="" src="Editor.png" name="Graphic1"></p>
<p align="justify"><br>These are normal data entry fields. &nbsp;You
move between them using the mouse, tabs, backspace, arrow keys etc.
&nbsp;The buttons at the bottom of the window are primarily for
moving between or acting upon an entry in the database. &nbsp;The
arrow keys from left to right allow you to move to the FIRST,
PREVIOUS, NEXT or LAST entry in the database. &nbsp;The ordering of
the database is controlled by the sort selection of CALLSIGN sort or
NET NBR sort. &nbsp;You may also go to a specific data entry using a
browse window. &nbsp;The browse window will either be by callsign or
by net nbr.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" align="center"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 312px; height: 259px;" alt="" src="BrowseCallsign.png" name="Graphic2"></p>
<p align="justify"><br>This view shows the callsign browse window.
&nbsp;Click on the desired callsign and press OK. &nbsp;Pressing
Cancel just returns to the Editor window with no changes. &nbsp;You
may also search for a callsign by Prefix, Area &amp; Suffix; or by
just Suffix alone. &nbsp;The search window looks like:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" align="center"><img src="SearchCallsign.jpg" name="Graphic3" align="bottom" border="0" height="139" width="213"></p>
<p align="justify"><br>You do not need to be concered about upper/lower
case letters.</p>
<h3 align="justify">Importing data from QRZ database</h3>
<p align="justify">If you own a copy of the QRZ database CDROM you may
opt to fill in all of the available entries from that source.&nbsp;
Be sure to enter the Prefix, Area, and Suffix entries and then press
the QRZ menu button.&nbsp; The program will search for the QRZ
database (first on the hard drive(s)) and then on available CD
drives.&nbsp; Place the QRZ CD in the drive before selecting this
option.&nbsp; For really speedy searches against the QRZ database I
suggest copying the entire "callbk" directory from the CD
to your c: drive if you are using Windows.</p>
<h3 align="justify">Exporting the database:</h3>
<p align="justify">You may export the entire database to a text file by
clicking on the <b>Export</b> menu item. &nbsp;A
comma-separated-value file will be created which contains one line
per database entry, for the entire database. &nbsp;The first line of
this file is a field description line. &nbsp;The name of this file
will be the same as the name of the database file but with the
extension <b>".csv"</b>. &nbsp;Microsoft Excel, Microsoft
Works, &nbsp;Star Office, Open Office and other spreadsheet programs
can either open or import this type of file. &nbsp;All of the
database can then be viewed or manipulated using the spreadsheet
program. &nbsp;The program Net will not be written to emulate what
these programs do so well. &nbsp;Therefore you will not find a print
function or any other formatting tools within the net program.
